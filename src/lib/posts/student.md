Let me start this off by saying that I do not claim to be an authoritative expert on the subject of graphic design. Sure, I know some things. I'm technically a professional. But I also personally know at least a dozen people more qualified to write this list than I am. And I am going to express a few opinions with which they may disagree. So the following advice is mine, and it comes merely from my looking back at my own time as a graphic design student and the work it produced, with the benefit of a little bit of perspective and time. Hopefully it will be helpful in navigating you through the pitfalls I failed to avoid. (In other words, I can write this, because I've personally made just about all of these mistakes myself.)
